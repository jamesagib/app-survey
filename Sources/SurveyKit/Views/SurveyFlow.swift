/// SurveyFlow is a SwiftUI view that manages a multi-step survey interface.
/// It handles the presentation of questions, collection of answers, and navigation between survey steps.
///
/// The view includes:
/// - A horizontal step indicator showing progress
/// - Display of the current survey question
/// - Navigation buttons for moving between questions
/// - Automatic answer validation and storage
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// let questions = [SurveyQuestion(...), SurveyQuestion(...)]
/// SurveyFlow(questions: questions) { question, answers in
///     // Handle each answer
/// } onCompletion: {
///     // Handle survey completion
/// }
/// ```
